# steam-salien-cheat
Simulates the playing of the "Summer Saliens" game on steam. Automatically chooses a planet/zone that will give you the max exp. Will switch between planets/zones once they're completed.

## Steps
1. Visit https://steamcommunity.com/saliengame/gettoken when logged in and copy all contents from the page
2. Open a new file named as token.json and paste the contents in it.
3. Open a command line/terminal and run the program as `python saliens.py`

#### Note:
- You need to have python 3 installed
- You need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all needed modules, before you can run the script
- You can open token_example.json to check whether your token's format is correctly

### Join Zone Error?
- Stop the script, wait 2 minutes, then re-run 
- OR, leave the script running and wait for the 2 minute cooldown to finish
